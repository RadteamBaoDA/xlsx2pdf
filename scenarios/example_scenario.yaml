# Scenario Configuration Example
#
# A scenario allows you to convert files from multiple folders with different settings.
# Each group defines input folders, output location, and specific conversion config.

# Scenario metadata
name: "Multi-Department Conversion"
description: "Convert documents from different departments with appropriate settings"

# Groups: Each group has its own folders and configuration
groups:
  # Group 1: Finance Department - Excel heavy, needs detailed settings
  - name: "Finance"
    folders:
      - "./input/finance"
      - "./input/accounting"
    output: "./output/finance_pdfs"
    config: "./configs/finance_config.yaml"  # Path to config file for this group
  
  # Group 2: Marketing Department - PowerPoint presentations
  - name: "Marketing"
    folders:
      - "./input/marketing"
    output: "./output/marketing_pdfs"
    config: "./configs/marketing_config.yaml"
  
  # Group 3: HR Department - Word documents
  - name: "HR"
    folders:
      - "./input/hr"
      - "./input/hr_archive"
    output: "./output/hr_pdfs"
    config: "./configs/hr_config.yaml"
  
  # Group 4: Mixed files with inline config (no separate config file)
  - name: "General"
    folders:
      - "./input/general"
    output: "./output/general_pdfs"
    config_inline:  # Inline config instead of separate file
      excel:
        prepare_for_print: false
      print_options:
        mode: "auto"
        page_size: "A4"
        orientation: "auto"
      word_options:
        create_bookmarks: true
        optimize_for_print: true
      powerpoint_options:
        output_type: "slides"
        include_hidden_slides: false
      pdf_trim:
        enabled: true

# Notes:
# - Files are automatically recognized by extension (.xlsx, .docx, .pptx, etc.)
# - The appropriate config section (excel, word_options, powerpoint_options) is applied
# - Folder structure is preserved in output directories
# - You can use either 'config' (path to YAML) or 'config_inline' (embedded config)
